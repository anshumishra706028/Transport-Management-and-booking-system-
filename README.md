The Transport Management and Booking System is an application designed and developed using Java for frontend and backend, and Oracle Database for storing and managing data. The main objective of this system is to make transport booking, vehicle scheduling, and overall management easier and more efficient by replacing manual work with a digital solution.
In the frontend, built with Java Swing/JavaFX, users interact through a simple and clean interface. They can register, log in, search for available routes, check vehicle details, and book or cancel tickets. Once a booking is made, the system generates a ticket and stores details securely in the Oracle database. Passengers can also access booking history, payment status, and other details. This helps in maintaining clarity and transparency.
The backend, developed in Core Java, is connected to Oracle Database through JDBC. It handles all important business logic like user authentication, booking validation, ticket generation, payment management, and schedule updates. Oracle ensures that all records – users, vehicles, routes, drivers, and bookings – are stored in structured relational tables. Queries and constraints in Oracle provide consistency, accuracy, and fast retrieval of data whenever needed.
For administrators, the system provides features to manage the transport operations smoothly. Admins can add new vehicles, assign drivers, update schedules, and monitor bookings. They can also generate reports for analyzing revenue, checking transport usage, and ensuring proper resource management. This feature helps managers to make better decisions and keep services reliable.
The combination of Java and Oracle makes the system secure, scalable, and performance-oriented. Java provides platform independence and flexibility for user interaction, while Oracle ensures data integrity and centralized storage. Together, they create a robust environment for transport service management.
Overall, the Transport Management and Booking System reduces errors, saves time, and improves service quality. It bridges the gap between passengers and administrators, offering a smooth booking experience for users and efficient management tools for operators. This project is a complete and practical solution for digital transport services.
